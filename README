Did you ever want a local wiki, editable in web browser or that can be populated by your scripts?
Well, localwiki is such wiki, it uses bottle (http://bottlepy.org) to include a templating engine, wsgi and a webserver in one python file :)

This is work in progress, so stay tuned for more improvements 

How to use localwiki:

Fetch both files

run ./wiki.py

Open localhost:8080 in your browser, which will show all available articles.

use localhost:8080/foo to see article foo
use localhost:8080/foo/edit to edit contents of foo
use localhost:8080/foo/del to delete foo

The wiki will create it's own database (wiki.db) which is a python shelve persistance object, so all data is stored there in key:value pairs.
Shelve is just a on-disk dictionary, so you can open it in all your scripts and well, do what ever you want.

And if you wonder why i created such a wierd interface, try the following in your browser:

Ctrl+L (focuses on address bar)
Tab (Focuses on entry window)
Tab (Focuses on submit, enter, submitted :))

So yes, the wiki is made for keyboard using users in mind...
More keyboard focused improvements, smarter markup and more stuff in the next commit :)

Have fun...
